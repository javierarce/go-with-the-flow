# Go With The Flow

Hi! Here's the support page for the award winning (and probably full of bugs) [Go With The Flow](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/964835595999796629/Go-with-the-Flow) plugin, the number one solution to do text threading in Figma.

If you found a bug (sorry!) or want to suggest an improvement (thanks!), please [open an issue here](https://github.com/javierarce/go-with-the-flow/issues/new/choose).
