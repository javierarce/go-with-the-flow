# Go With The Flow

Hi! Here's the support page for the award winning (and probably full of bugs) "Go With The Flow" plugin, the number one solution to do text threading in Figma.

If you found a bug (sorry!) or want to suggest an improvement (thanks!), please [open an issue here](https://github.com/javierarce/go-with-the-flow/issues/new/choose).
